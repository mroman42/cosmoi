Fox's theorem says that the forgetful functor $U \colon \mathbf{Cat} \to \mathbf{SymMon}$ 
from cartesian to symmetric monoidal categories has a right adjoint 
$\mathbf{Comon} \colon \mathbf{SymMon} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ given by the category of
cocommutative comonoids.  Dually, commutative monoids have the same correspondence with
cocartesian categories. A [[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2018/02/cartesian_bicategories.html][bicategory of relations]] is a cartesian bicategory where every
object is a Frobenius monoid. What are other instances of this correspondence?
