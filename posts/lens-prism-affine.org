#+Title: Lenses, prisms, affine traversals

Lenses and prisms do not compose into affine traversals if one is
inclined to believe that Haskell composition of Tambara modules is the
definition of composition of optics for optics of different families.
I will construct a counterexample that illustrates this fact. I will,
however, respect the laws of Tambara modules, and not make use of any
freedoms that the limited expressivity of Haskell's type system would
give me.  The failure is theoretical, not only a product of this
particular implementation.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
-- Consider the constantly Bool profunctor.
data CBool a b = CBool Bool
class Profunctor CBool where
  dimap _ _ = id

-- It is a strong profunctor, respecting the laws.
class Strong CBool where
  strong = id
