#+Title: Dedekind reals in Agda

For my Bachelor's dissertation I wrote an implementation of the
positive Dedekind real numbers in Agda.  The formalization is not
completely sound, using =--type-in-type= to simplify dealing with
universes; but it is enough to successfully compile to Haskell code
and compute the first digits of the binary representation of =sqrt(2)=
from its definition.

The code is on [[https://github.com/mroman42/dedekind-reals][GitHub]].
