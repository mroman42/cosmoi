<h1 class="title">Picado's Interview with Lawvere</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/">Jorge Picado</a> (who is also coauthor of the book on <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/frames-and-locales-topology-without-points">locales</a> I am reading) has
many nice 'popularisation of mathematics' articles on his webpage. I
have enjoyed a lot his interview with William Lawvere.

<p>
Specially interesting is this criticism to the extra-mathematical
publicity around Gödel's theorem. However, I cannot locate exactly
what 'organized attempts' is he referring to.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Diagonal arguments and Cartesian closed categories we demystified
the incompleteness theorem of Gödel and the truth-definition theory of
Tarski by showing that both are consequences of some very simple
algebra in the Cartesian-closed setting. It was always hard for many
to comprehend how Cantor’s mathematical theorem could be re-christened
as a “paradox” by Russell and how Gödel’s theorem could be so often
declared to be the most significant result of the 20th century.  There
was always the suspicion among scientists that such extra-mathematical
publicity movements concealed an agenda for re-establishing belief as
a substitute for science. Now, one hundred years after Gödel’s birth,
the organized attempts to harness his great mathematical work to such
an agenda have become explicit.
